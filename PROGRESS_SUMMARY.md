## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Test Query Processing
```bash
cd /Users/nitin/.cursor/worktrees/AI_policy_Assistant/MKM79

python -c "
from src.query_processing.pipeline import QueryProcessingPipeline
pipeline = QueryProcessingPipeline()
result = pipeline.process('What is the PTR in Guntur for 2023-24?')
print(result)
"
```

### Run Vertical Processing
```bash
# Process Legal vertical
python scripts/process_vertical.py --vertical Legal

# Process all verticals
python scripts/process_vertical.py --all
```

### View Documentation
```bash
# Main docs
cat docs/STAGE1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
cat docs/WORK_DELEGATION_PLAN.md

# Organized documents
cat data/organized_documents/README.md
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Query Processing → Agent Router
```
ProcessedQuery {
  normalized_query,
  entities,
  primary_intent,
  suggested_verticals
} → Router selects agent(s)
```

### Processed Docs → Vector Store
```
Vertical Processing {
  extracted_text,
  metadata,
  entities,
  chunks
} → Embeddings → Qdrant
```

### Knowledge Graph → Retrieval
```
Bridge Table {
  entity_relationships,
  supersession_chains,
  cross_references
} → Graph queries
```
