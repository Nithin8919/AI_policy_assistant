- confidence: 0%
- citations: None
```

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify Qdrant collections have data
2. Test EnhancedRouter directly
3. Debug collection name mapping
4. Validate embeddings exist

**Time to Fix:** 4-8 hours

### Issue #2: Gemini Provider Broken üî¥
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** 2 out of 3 queries fail with Gemini

**Error:**
```python
Error: list index (0) out of range
```

**Next Steps:**

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Today (Next 4 hours)
1. üî¥ **Debug Qdrant retrieval**
   ```bash
   # Verify Qdrant has data
   curl $QDRANT_URL/collections/government_orders/points/count \
     -H "api-key: $QDRANT_API_KEY"
   
   # Test EnhancedRouter directly
   python -c "
   from src.agents.enhanced_router import EnhancedRouter
   import os
   router = EnhancedRouter(
       qdrant_url=os.getenv('QDRANT_URL'),
       qdrant_api_key=os.getenv('QDRANT_API_KEY')
   )
   result = router.route_query('What is RTE Act?')
   print(f'Results: {len(result.retrieval_results)}')
   for r in result.retrieval_results:
       print(f'  {r.agent_name}: {len(r.chunks)} chunks')
   "
   ```

2. üî¥ **If no data in Qdrant, regenerate embeddings**
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_embeddings.py
   ```
