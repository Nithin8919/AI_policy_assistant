## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS (ALL REPORTS)

### Issue #1: Qdrant Retrieval Not Working 🔴
**Status:** BLOCKING  
**Discovered:** October 30, 2025  
**Evidence:** Test results show 0 chunks retrieved  
**Impact:** System doesn't answer from real documents  
**Fix Time:** 4-8 hours  
**Priority:** Fix TODAY

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Verify Qdrant collections have data
   ```bash
   curl $QDRANT_URL/collections
   curl $QDRANT_URL/collections/government_orders/points/count
   ```

2. Test EnhancedRouter directly
   ```python
   from src.agents.enhanced_router import EnhancedRouter
   router = EnhancedRouter(url, key)
   result = router.route_query("What is RTE Act?")
   print(f"Chunks: {len(result.retrieval_results)}")
   ```

3. Fix any issues found
4. Validate with test script

**Status:** HIGH PRIORITY  
**Discovered:** October 30, 2025  
**Evidence:** 2 out of 3 queries fail with IndexError  
**Impact:** 67% failure rate on Gemini  
**Fix Time:** 2 hours  
**Priority:** Fix TOMORROW

**Fix Required:**
```python
# Add response validation
if response.candidates and len(response.candidates) > 0:
    content = response.candidates[0].content
    if content.parts and len(content.parts) > 0:
        answer = content.parts[0].text
    else:
        raise ValueError("No content in response")
else:
